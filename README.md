                                    SYNTHETIC DATASET GENERATION FOR DDOS ATTACKS
In network intrusion detection (IDS), anomaly-based approaches in particular suffer from accurate evaluation, comparison, and deployment which originates from the scarcity of adequate datasets. Many such datasets are internal and cannot be shared due to privacy issues, others are heavily anonymized and do not reflect current trends, or they lack certain statistical characteristics. These deficiencies are primarily the reasons why a perfect dataset is yet to exist. Thus, researchers must resort to datasets which they can obtain that are often suboptimal.As network behaviors and patterns change and intrusions evolve, it has very much become necessary to move away from static and one-time datasets toward more dynamically generated datasets which not only reflect the traffic compositions and intrusions of that time, but are also modifiable, extensible, and reproducible.The profiles are then employed in an experiment to generate the desirable dataset in a testbed environment. Various multi-stage attacks scenarios were subsequently carried out to supply the anomalous portion of the dataset. The intend for this dataset is to assist various researchers in acquiring datasets of this kind for testing, evaluation, and comparison purposes, through sharing the generated datasets and profiles.
          
          SASTRA Intrusion Detection Evaluation Data Set pocesses the following characteristics:
          
          * Realistic network and traffic
          * Complete capture
          * Diverse intrusion scenarios
          
          
Distributed Denial of Service(DDOS) is a type of DOS attack where multiple compromised systems, which are often infected with a Trojan, are used to target a single system causing a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Victims of a DDoS attack consist of both the end targeted system and all systems maliciously used and controlled by the hacker in the distributed attack.So,our work mainly focuses on generating firehose of network packets for various kinds of DDOS attacks. SASTRA IDS dataset consists of 13 varieties of network based DDOS attacks which attackers usually carryout to take down the network. Environmental setup, server configuration, attack description, tools used and python scripts for dataset generation and preprocessing will be available in my repository.

SASTRA IDS dataset consists of labeled network traces, including full packet payloads in pcap format, which along with the relevant profiles are publicly available for researchers. For more information, contact sriram@it.sastra.edu.

NOTE:
These scripts should be used only for educational purpose and practice in environment where you have the ownership to carryout these operations.
